function [spikewaves, spikecounts, clustIDs] = dg_lookupSpikeWaveSE( ...
    clusts, TS, samp)
% Functionally analogous to dg_lookupSpikeWaveforms, but for Single
% Electrode data.  Also, this does not attempt to do any kind of fancy
% stuff with finding or even reading files, it just operates on
% already-read data.  If there is a cluster #0 in <clusts>, it is ignored.
% Any spikes in <TS> that do not belong to a cluster with a nonzero ID
% number are considered to belong to cluster #0
%INPUTS
% clusts: a numeric array containing timestamps in the first column,
%   cluster ID numbers in the second column, and one row for each spike.
%   May contain additional columns, but they are ignored.
% TS: Timestamps read from raw SE (*.nse) file.
% samp: Spike waveform samples read from raw SE (*.nse) file; one row per
%   spike, one column per sample (note this is not the format returned by
%   dg_readSpike).
%OUTPUTS
% spikewaves: one row per spike; col. 1 = timestamp, col. 2 = clustIDs, col.
%   3:end = waveform samples.
% spikecounts: one row per value of clustIDs; col. 1 = number of spikes in
%   <clusts>, col. 2 = number of spikes in <TS> and therefore in
%   <spikewaves>.
% clustIDs: column vector of numerical cluster IDs as given in <clusts>, in
%   ascending order, not including cluster #0 if there is one.
