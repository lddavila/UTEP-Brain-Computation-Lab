function [samples, numglitches] = dg_deglitch(samples, thresh)
%DG_DEGLITCH removes single-sample spikes from sampled data
%samples, numglitches = dg_deglitch(samples, thresh)
%  Returns the same sample data that was passed in, modified by
%  replacing single-sample glitches with the average of the two surrounding
%  samples.  A single-sample glitch is defined as a sample that differs
%  from its predecessor by more than <thresh>, but which is followed by a
%  sample that differs by less than <thresh>.  <numglitches> is the number
%  of glitches that were removed.
