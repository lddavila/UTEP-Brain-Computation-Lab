function [table, trialIDs] = dg_readEyeTab(filename)
%[trialIDs, table] = dg_readEyeTab(filename)
% Reads files produced by lfp_EyeTabulation and returns values in same
%   format returned by lfp_EyeTabulation.
% <filename> is the relative or absolute pathname to a tab-delimited text
%   file.  If the file has seven columns, it is a fixations file.   If it
%   has 8 columns, then it is a saccades file.  If it has some other number
%   of columns, a warning is issued and processing continues.
% <table> is a cell array equal to the <fixations> or <saccades> value
%   returned by lfp_EyeTabulation.
% <trialIDs> is a cell string array of the Unique Trial IDs whose data
%   produced the fixations or saccades file.  Note that trials for which no
%   fixations or saccades were recorded do not appear in the files, so it
%   is possible for there to be a trial that was selected that nonetheless
%   does not appear in <trialIDs>.

% C is now a cell array of the same shape as the table that was read, with
% trialnums in first column, Unique Trial IDs in the second, and fixations
% or saccades values in the remaining columns.

% Get trialIDs in the same order in which they occur in the file, which is
% not necessarily sorted; but the trialnums in col 1 are sorted, and can
% speed it up:
trialnums = zeros(size(C,1),1);
for k = 2:length(trialnums)
    trialnums(k) = sscanf(C{k,1}, '%d');
end
firstrows = [ 2
    find(trialnums(3:end) ~= trialnums(2:end-1)) + 2 ];

% Construct output table:

for trialidx = 1:length(trialIDs)
    if trialidx == length(trialIDs)
        lastrow = size(C,1);
    else

        for col = 3:ncol
            data(ridx,col-2) = sscanf(C{rows(ridx),col}, '%g');
