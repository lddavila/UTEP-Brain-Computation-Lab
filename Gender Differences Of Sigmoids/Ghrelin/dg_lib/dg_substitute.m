function result = dg_substitute(str1, str2, str3)
%DG_SUBSTITUTE performs a global search-and-replace operation on a string.
%dg_substitute(str1, str2, str3)
%  Search str1 for any instances of str2, and replace each instance with
%  str3.  The search is case-sensitive.  If the str1 and str2 contain
%  repeats such that str2 matches some of the same character positions
%  multiple times, only the left-most of the overlapping matches is used.
