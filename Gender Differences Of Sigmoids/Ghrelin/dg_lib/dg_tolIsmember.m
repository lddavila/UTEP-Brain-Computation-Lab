function result = dg_tolIsmember(A, B, tol)
%result = dg_tolIsmember(A, B, tol)
%   Returns the same result as ismember(A,B) where A and B are both numeric
%   vectors, except that values of A and B that differ by strictly less
%   than tol are considered to be equal.  Note that if tol = 0, then
%   <result> is all false. It is assumed that A and B are already sorted in
%   ascending
%   order.
%NOTES
% The Matlab 'ismember' says it uses a method which sorts list, then
% performs binary search.  However, it calls a C function to do the actual
% binary search, so this won't be as fast.  However, we *can* take
% advantage of the fact that *both* lists are sorted.
