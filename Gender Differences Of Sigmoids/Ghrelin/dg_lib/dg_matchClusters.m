function [clusterpairs, correl] = dg_matchClusters( ...
    fn1, fn2, thresh, varargin)
% Reads two files of cluster data from .MAT files <fn1>, <fn2>, and
% returns a list of clusters that match across the two files.
% Alternatively, numeric arrays containing the cluster data can be supplied
% instead of filenames for <fn1> and/or <fn2>, in which case the data
% supplied are used instead of reading data from a file.  The computation
% does not depend on how many wires worth of data the waveforms represent,
% so this function can be used with tetrode, stereotrode, or single
% electrode data.
%
% OUTPUT
% <clusterpairs> has two columns: the first contains a cluster ID from
% <fn1> and the second contains the last cluster ID from <fn2> whose
% waveform correlation coefficient with the cluster from <fn1> exceeds
% <thresh>.  Note that <thresh> should be adjusted so that there cannot be
% more than one pair with correl coeff > thresh.  <correl> is the matrix of
% correlation coefficients indexed by clusters from <fn1> on rows and
% clusters from <fn2> in columns.
%
% INPUT
% As for lfp_add 'Multiple Cut Cluster (*.MAT)', each file must contain an
% array with cluster ID in col 2 as first variable saved (does not care
% what its name is; col 1 is not used here but is tolerated for
% compatibility).  The remainder of the columns in the array must contain
% spike waveform sample data concatenated from all wires, i.e. if it is
% tetrode data with 32 samples per wire then there will 128 columns of
% waveform sample data.  It does not matter how many columns are actually
% supplied, as long as it is the same number of columns in each file.
%
% OPTIONS
% 'badwire', badwirelist - numbering the wires 1 - 4 in the same order in
%   which the sample channels appear in the columns of fn1 and fn2, all
%   sample values for any wires that appear in <badwirelist> are set to
%   zero in both cluster sets.  In the case of stereotrode data, address
%   the first wire as 1:2 and the second wire as 3:4.  WARNING: all other
%   things being equal, this will generally reduce the separation in
%   correlation values between repeated units and distinct units, to a
%   greater degree for each additional wire ignored.  However, it may
%   actually improve the separation in the situation for which it is
%   intended, i.e. where one wire has clearly gone bad.  Suffice it to say
%   that statistics and thresholds computed for four wires do not transfer
%   to three wires.
% 'ktfilenames' - passed through to dg_lookupSpikeWaveforms if necessary.
% 'plexonnames' - passed through to dg_lookupSpikeWaveforms if necessary.
% 'lookup' - this must be specified if fn1 and fn2 are ordinary 'Multiple
%   Cut Cluster (*.MAT)' files that do not contain waveform data.  The
%   waveform data is looked up from a matching Neuralynx tetrode data file
%   (if it can be found).
%
% EXAMPLES
% dg_matchClusters('file1', 'file2', .98, 'badwire', 4)
%   Matches clusters between file1 and file2 with a threshold of .98, but
%   ignoring any data on wire 4 in both files.  In this case, file1 and
%   file2 must contain full waveform data.
% dg_matchClusters('file1', 'file2', .99, 'lookup', 'badwire', [2 4])
%   Looks for the Neuralynx files containing the raw data that correspond
%   to file1 and file2, then compares clusters between them with a
%   threshold of .99 ignoring data on wire 2 AND wire 4 in both files.
