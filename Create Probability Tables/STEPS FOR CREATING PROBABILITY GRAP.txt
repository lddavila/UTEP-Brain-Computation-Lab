STEPS FOR CREATING PROBABILITY GRAPHS:

1.) Create the psychometric functions for whatever experiment you want to use
2.) Fit those functions with sigmoids/parabolas/lines
3.) Cluster your sigmoid data 
4.) Create files containing the Max Vs Shift Clusters data
5.) Take the random name given to each cluster file and rename it to the correct name
6.) Now you're ready to begin
7.) Create a variable that appears as follows 

DataSets = ["Experiment you're analyzing|Travel Pixel","Experiment you're analyzing|Stopping Points","Experiment you're analyzing|Rotation Points","Experiment you're analyzing|Reward Choice"];

8.) Now call collectAllDataInAMap as follows

	newData = collectAllDataInAMap(DataSets);

9.)  Now call storeClustersInNewDirectory() as follows

	directoryWhereYouWantToStoreYourClusters = storeClustersInNewDirectory("Name of directory you want, in string format");

10.) Call getSizeOFAllDataSets() as follows
	
	sizeOfEachDataSets = getSizeOfAllDataSets(newData)

11.) Call getSizesOfEachCluster() as follows
	
	sizeOfEachClusterInEachDataSet = getSizeOfEachCluster("directory where all your cluster files are stored, in string format")

12.) Call calculatePopulationProbabilities() as follows
	
	probabilities = calculatePopulationProbabilities(sizeOfEachClusterInEachDataSet,sizeofEachDataSet);

13.) Use the following code to save your work in the workspace
	
	assignin('base','nameYouWantToStoreProbabilitiesAsInTheWorkspace',probabilities)

14.) You now have a map where the keys are the cluster names, and the values are probabilities of a rat belonging to that specific cluster given that it exists in the data set, stored in your workspace as nameYouWantToStoreProbabilitiesAsInTheWorkSpace

15.) You can save these into a table with the following (KEEP THE "Cluster_Names" AND "Probabilities" variable names, otherwise code below this step won't work)
	
	Cluster_Names = keys(nameYouWantToStoreProbabilitiesASInTheWorkSpace).';
	Probabilities = values(nameYouWantToStoreProbabilitiesAsInTheWorkSpace).';
	tableOfClustersToProbabilities = table(Cluster_Names, Probabilities);

16.) Now Write this table using the following line of code
	
	writetable(tableOfClustersToProbabilities,'FileNameYouWant.xlsx')

17.) now call countRatAppearencesInDataSet() as follows
	
	eachRatsAppearenceInTheDataSet = countRatAppearencesInDataSet(newData)


18.) Call countRatAppearencesInCluster()
	
	eachRatsAppearenceInEachCluster = countRatAppearencesInCluster(directoryWhereYouWantToStoreYourClusters);

20.) The data produced in steps 17 and 18 can be stored by repeating steps 13,14,15,16

21.)
